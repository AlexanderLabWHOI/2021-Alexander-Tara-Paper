This update features a major scaling up of the resource coverage, sampling the genomic diversity of 1271 eukaryotes, 6013 prokaryotes and 6488 viruses. These include putative orthologs among 448 metazoan, 117 plant, 549 fungal, 148 protist, 5609 bacterial, andÂ 404 archaeal genomes, picking up the best sequenced and annotated representatives for each species or operational taxonomic unit. OrthoDB relies on a concept of hierarchy of levels-of-orthology to enable more finely resolved gene orthologies for more closely related species. Since orthologs are the most likely candidates to retain functions of their ancestor gene, OrthoDB is aimed at narrowing down hypotheses about gene functions and enabling comparative evolutionary studies. Optional registered-user sessions allow on-line BUSCO assessments of gene set completeness and mapping of the uploaded data to OrthoDB to enable further interactive exploration of related annotations and generation of comparative charts. The accelerating expansion of genomics data continues to add valuable information, and OrthoDB strives to provide orthologs from the broadest coverage of species, as well as to extensively collate available functional annotations and to compute evolutionary annotations. The data can be browsed online, downloaded or assessed via REST API or SPARQL RDF compatible with both UniProt and Ensembl.}",

abstract = {Metagenomic datasets contain billions of protein sequences that could greatly enhance large-scale functional annotation and structure prediction. Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of millions of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 h on a single server to 50{\%} sequence identity, {\textgreater}1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases.},

abstract = {The accelerating pace of genome sequencing throughout the tree of life is driving the need for improved unsupervised annotation of genome components such as transposable elements (TEs). Because the types and sequences of TEs are highly variable across species, automated TE discovery and annotation are challenging and time-consuming tasks. A critical first step is the de novo identification and accurate compilation of sequence models representing all of the unique TE families dispersed in the genome. Here we introduce RepeatModeler2, a pipeline that greatly facilitates this process. This program brings substantial improvements over the original version of RepeatModeler, one of the most widely used tools for TE discovery. In particular, this version incorporates a module for structural discovery of complete long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which are widespread in eukaryotic genomes but recalcitrant to automated identification because of their size and sequence complexity. We benchmarked RepeatModeler2 on three model species with diverse TE landscapes and high-quality, manually curated TE libraries: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), Danio rerio (zebrafish), and Oryza sativa (rice). In these three species, RepeatModeler2 identified approximately 3 times more consensus sequences matching with {\textgreater}95{\%} sequence identity and sequence coverage to the manually curated sequences than the original RepeatModeler. As expected, the greatest improvement is for LTR retroelements. Thus, RepeatModeler2 represents a valuable addition to the genome annotation toolkit that will enhance the identification and study of TEs in eukaryotic genome sequences.

abstract = {Finding new protein-coding genes is one of the most important goals of eukaryotic genome sequencing projects. However, genomic organization of novel eukaryotic genomes is diverse and ab initio gene finding tools tuned up for previously studied species are rarely suitable for efficacious gene hunting in DNA sequences of a new genome. Gene identification methods based on cDNA and expressed sequence tag (EST) mapping to genomic DNA or those using alignments to closely related genomes rely either on existence of abundant cDNA and EST data and/ or availability on reference genomes. Conventional statistical ab initio methods require large training sets of validated genes for estimating gene model parameters. In practice, neither one of these types of data may be available in sufficient amount until rather late stages of the novel genome sequencing. Nevertheless, we have shown that gene finding in eukaryotic genomes could be carried out in parallel with statistical models estimation directly from yet anonymous genomic DNA. The suggested method of parallelization of gene prediction with the model parameters estimation follows the path of the iterative Viterbi training. Rounds of genomic sequence labeling into coding and non-coding regions are followed by the rounds of model parameters estimation. Several dynamically changing restrictions on the possible range of model parameters are added to filter out fluctuations in the initial steps of the algorithm that could redirect the iteration process away from the biologically relevant point in parameter space. Tests on well-studied eukaryotic genomes have shown that the new method performs comparably or better than conventional methods where the supervised model training precedes the gene prediction step. Several novel genomes have been analyzed and biologically interesting findings are discussed. Thus, a self-training algorithm that had been assumed feasible only for prokaryotic genomes has now been developed for ab initio eukaryotic gene identification. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

@article{Bruna2020,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We have made several steps toward creating a fast and accurate algorithm for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes. First, we introduced an automated method for efficient ab initio gene finding, GeneMark-ES, with parameters trained in iterative unsupervised mode. Next, in GeneMark-ET we proposed a method of integration of unsupervised training with information on intron positions revealed by mapping short RNA reads. Now we describe GeneMark-EP, a tool that utilizes another source of external information, a protein database, readily available prior to the start of a sequencing project. A new specialized pipeline, ProtHint, initiates massive protein mapping to genome and extracts hints to splice sites and translation start and stop sites of potential genes. GeneMark-EP uses the hints to improve estimation of model parameters as well as to adjust coordinates of predicted genes if they disagree with the most reliable hints (the -EP+ mode). Tests of GeneMark-EP and -EP+ demonstrated improvements in gene prediction accuracy in comparison with GeneMark-ES, while the GeneMark-EP+ showed higher accuracy than GeneMark-ET. We have observed that the most pronounced improvements in gene prediction accuracy happened in large eukaryotic genomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{LevyKarin2020,
abstract = {Background: Metagenomics is revolutionizing the study of microorganisms and their involvement in biological, biomedical, and geochemical processes, allowing us to investigate by direct sequencing a tremendous diversity of organisms without the need for prior cultivation. Unicellular eukaryotes play essential roles in most microbial communities as chief predators, decomposers, phototrophs, bacterial hosts, symbionts, and parasites to plants and animals. Investigating their roles is therefore of great interest to ecology, biotechnology, human health, and evolution. However, the generally lower sequencing coverage, their more complex gene and genome architectures, and a lack of eukaryote-specific experimental and computational procedures have kept them on the sidelines of metagenomics. Results: MetaEuk is a toolkit for high-throughput, reference-based discovery, and annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. It performs fast searches with 6-frame-translated fragments covering all possible exons and optimally combines matches into multi-exon proteins. We used a benchmark of seven diverse, annotated genomes to show that MetaEuk is highly sensitive even under conditions of low sequence similarity to the reference database. To demonstrate MetaEuk's power to discover novel eukaryotic proteins in large-scale metagenomic data, we assembled contigs from 912 samples of the Tara Oceans project. MetaEuk predicted {\textgreater}12,000,000 protein-coding genes in 8 days on ten 16-core servers. Most of the discovered proteins are highly diverged from known proteins and originate from very sparsely sampled eukaryotic supergroups. Conclusion: The open-source (GPLv3) MetaEuk software (https://github.com/soedinglab/metaeuk) enables large-scale eukaryotic metagenomics through reference-based, sensitive taxonomic and functional annotation.

abstract = {Coccolithophores have influenced the global climate for over 200 million years. These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of total carbon fixation in some systems. They form blooms that can occupy hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and are distinguished by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate exoskeletons (coccoliths), rendering them visible from space. Although coccolithophores export carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the sea floor, they also release CO 2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO 2 production or uptake, sequestration and export to the deep ocean. Here we report the first haptophyte reference genome, from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and sequences from 13 additional isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core genes plus genes distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an atypical complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a single species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic repertoires. Genome variability within this species complex seems to underpin its capacity both to thrive in habitats ranging from the equator to the subarctic and to form large-scale episodic blooms under a wide variety of environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The profound influence ofmarine plankton on the global carbon cycle has been recognized for decades, particularly for photosynthetic microbes that form the base of ocean food chains. However, a comprehensive model of the carbon cycle is challenged by unicellular eukaryotes (protists) having evolved complex behavioral strategies and organismal interactions that extend far beyond photosynthetic lifestyles. As is also true for multicellular eukaryotes, these strategies and their associated physiological changes are difficult to deduce from genome sequences or gene repertoires—a problem compounded by numerous unknown function proteins. Here, we explore protistan trophic modes in marine food webs and broader biogeochemical influences.We also evaluate approaches that could resolve their activities, link them to biotic and abiotic factors, and integrate them into an ecosystems biology framework.

@article{Alexander2015a,
abstract = {A diverse microbial assemblage in the ocean is responsible for nearly half of global primary production. It has been hypothesized and experimentally demonstrated that nutrient loading can stimulate blooms of large eukaryotic phytoplankton in oligotrophic systems. Although central to balancing biogeochemical models, knowledge of themetabolic traits that govern the dynamics of these bloom-forming phytoplankton is limited. We used eukaryotic metatranscriptomic techniques to identify the metabolic basis of functional group-specific traits that may drive the shift between net heterotrophy and autotrophy in the oligotrophic ocean. Replicated blooms were simulated by deep seawater (DSW) addition to mimic nutrient loading in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and the transcriptional re- sponses of phytoplankton functional groups were assayed. Re- sponses of the diatom, haptophyte, and dinoflagellate functional groups in simulated blooms were unique, with diatoms and hapto- phytes significantly (95{\%} confidence) shifting their quantitative metabolic fingerprint from the in situ condition, whereas dinoflagell- ates showed little response. Significantly differentially abundant genes identified the importance of colimitation by nutrients, metals, and vitamins in eukaryotic phytoplankton metabolism and bloom formation in this system. The variable transcript allocation ratio, used to quantify transcript reallocation following DSW amend- ment, differed for diatoms and haptophytes, reflecting the long- standing paradigm of phytoplankton r- and K-type growth strate- gies. Although the underlying metabolic potential of the large eukaryotic phytoplankton was consistently present, the lack of a bloom during the study period suggests a crucial dependence on physical and biogeochemical forcing, which are susceptible to alter- ation with changing climate.},

abstract = {Fungi from coastal environments have been widely studied with respect to the production of secondary metabolites and biotechnologically useful lignocellulolytic enzymes. A few studies on mycology of deep-sea sediments, however, have been carried out. This paper reports a study on alkaline, cold-tolerant proteases from deep-sea fungi. A total of 221 deep-sea isolates of fungi from 5000m in the Central Indian Basin were screened for the enzyme. Many of these grew and produced alkaline protease at 5 and 30°C and 1bar pressure. Aspergillus ustus (NIOCC #20) producing the highest amounts of the enzyme was selected for further studies. The growth yield was substantial at 30 and 5°C at 1bar and elevated hydrostatic pressures. The fungus produced alkaline, cold-tolerant protease when grown at 30°C and 1bar pressure. The enzyme was active at combinations of 30, 5°C and 50 and 300bar pressure. However, protease production was negligible when the fungus was grown at 5°C, under 1bar or elevated hydrostatic pressures. The enzyme produced at 30°C and 1bar pressure was further characterized. The fungus produced a maximum of 1639ACUmL−1 of protease by day 7. The enzyme, with molecular mass of 32kDa and pI values of 6.6 and 6.9 showed several interesting properties. It had a broad pH range of 6–10, with an optimum at pH 9. The optimum temperature for protease activity was 45°C and approximately 10% of the activity was retained at 2°C. The enzyme was totally inhibited in the presence of 2mM PMSF suggesting it to be a serine protease. It was active in the presence of several commercial detergents at 2gL−1 concentration and in the presence of 0.5M NaCl, equivalent to 29 parts per thousand salinity. In the presence of stabilizing agents such as glycerol, CaCl2 its thermostability at 60°C was enhanced. Heavy metal ions Cu, Hg, Fe, Ni and Zn did not inhibit the enzyme activity considerably. This study indicates that fungi from deep-sea sediments could be a useful source of proteases.}
